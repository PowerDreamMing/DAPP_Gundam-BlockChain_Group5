# Instruction

First, we use the Web3 Framework to design the Decentralized Application to create blockchain. Our topic is the Gundam online NFT marketplace.
 The purpose of designing this project is to provide Gundam enthusiasts with a platform where they can purchase images related to Gundam.


 First, in the website user cab buy the image through MetaMask, also MetaMask was receive some gas for the fee. On the other hand, users can browse the images they have bought on the collection page. User also can resell the image. Finally, for the admin page , if you are admin which can modify the ETH of image.

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Web3 is a set of JavaScript libraries (such as  Web3.js or Ethers.js) that allow your Decentralized Application to interact with  smart contracts on the blockchain through the frontend. |                       |

| Ganache provides a fast, free, and resettable  blockchain environment that allows you to develop and test your DApp locally  without needing to connect to the actual Ethereum mainnet or testnet. |                       |

| MetaMask is a browser extension that serves as an  Ethereum wallet, a blockchain gateway, and a signature tool that helps users  interact with smart contracts. |                       |
| ![image-20250406170928612](http://pdm888.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20250406170928612.png) | **Solidity Language** |
| Solidity is the "smart contract language"  used in developing DApps. It functions as the backend logic on the  blockchain, responsible for implementing the core functionalities of your  DApp, such as purchasing and transferring tokens. |                       |
| ![](http://pdm888.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20250406170939090.png) | **Truffle Module**    |
| Truffle is a comprehensive blockchain application  development framework that assists in developing, compiling, deploying,  testing, and interacting with smart contracts, making your DApp projects  faster, more structured, and better managed. |                       |
| ![image-20250406171701401](http://pdm888.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20250406171701401.png) | **Node.js Module**    |
| In DApp projects, Node.js serves as the  foundational platform for the entire development environment. It supports  smart contract tools (such as Truffle and Hardhat), frontend Web3 libraries,  testing tools, server logic, automation workflows, and more. |                       |

# Using Command

Execution Type:

| ·   Run scripts using Node.js.                               | npm run dev                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ·   Redeploy all smart contracts to the blockchain.          | truffle migrate --reset                                      |
| ·   Convert the Solidity files of the smart contracts into ABI JSON files  for use by the DApp web framework. | truffle compile                                              |
| ·   Enable developers to use PowerShell commands in the Vscode Terminal. | Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy  RemoteSigned |

 

Installation Type:

| Use Node.js to install Truffle. | npm install -g truffle |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
|                                 |                        |

# Solving Problem

In admin.html, I will attempt to modify ETH, but we must ensure that the website's account owner matches the current account. Therefore, in the browser, press Ctrl+Shift+I to open the Developer Tools console, and then input the following commands into the console.

```
App.contracts.ImageStore.deployed().then(i => i.owner()).then(o  => console.log("Contract owner：", o));  
```

and

```  
web3.eth.getAccounts(function (err, accounts) {   console.log("current  account：", accounts[0]);  });  
```

To verify if the two match. If they do, we can be confident that we can modify the ETH in the admin at the current blockchain address. Otherwise, we must change the current account to the same account as the owner contract account.
